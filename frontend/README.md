# Biobank-ng Frontend Project

This project contains the source code for **Biobank-ng**'s web-client. It is a React application written in
TypeScript that uses React Functional Components.

This project has the following dependencies:

* [React](https://react.dev/reference/react)

    React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on
    components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies.

* [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)

    TanStack Query (FKA React Query) is often described as the missing data-fetching library for web
    applications, but in more technical terms, it makes fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server
    state in your web applications a breeze.

* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)

    React Router is a lightweight, fully-featured routing library for the React JavaScript library. React
    Router runs everywhere that React runs; on the web, on the server (using node.js), and on React Native.

* [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)

    Performant, flexible and extensible forms with easy-to-use validation.

* [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction)

    A small, fast, and scalable bearbones state management solution. Zustand has a comfy API based on hooks.
    It isn't boilerplatey or opinionated, but has enough convention to be explicit and flux-like.

* [Zod](https://zod.dev/)

    Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. I'm using the term "schema" to
    broadly refer to any data type, from a simple `string` to a complex nested object.

* [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

    Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open
    Source.

* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

    Utility classes help you work within the constraints of a system instead of littering your stylesheets
    with arbitrary values. They make it easy to be consistent with color choices, spacing, typography,
    shadows, and everything else that makes up a well-engineered design system.

* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/v5/docs/web/use-with/react)

    Font Awesome is the Internet's icon library and toolkit, used by millions of designers, developers, and
    content creators.

* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)

    Vite (French word for "quick", pronounced /vit/ï¿¼, like "veet") is a build tool that aims to provide a
    faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
